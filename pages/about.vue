              Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system
              and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized
              peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no
              central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin
              is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be
              seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in
              existence..
